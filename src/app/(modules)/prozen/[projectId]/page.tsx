/*
 * ProZen Project Detail Route Page
 * 
 * PURPOSE: Dynamic route entry point for individual project details
 * 
 * ‚úÖ COMPONENT STATUS: CLEAN ROUTE WRAPPER - Good delegation pattern
 * - Route: /prozen/[projectId]
 * - Function: Delegate to ProjectDetailPage component
 * - Integration: Bridge between Next.js routing and ProjectDetailPage component
 * 
 * üîç USAGE ANALYSIS:
 * - Dynamic route for individual project management
 * - No duplicates found - unique route wrapper
 * - Simple delegation pattern (though could extract projectId param)
 * - Clean separation between routing and business logic
 * 
 * ‚úÖ GOOD ROUTE PATTERN:
 * - **Minimal Responsibility**: Only handles route delegation
 * - **Clean Architecture**: Separates routing from component logic
 * - **Simple Implementation**: Straightforward component delegation
 * 
 * üîß MINOR IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITY:
 * - Could extract projectId from URL params and pass to component
 * - ProjectDetailPage likely handles param extraction internally
 * 
 * üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE BENEFITS:
 * - Next.js App Router dynamic route compliance
 * - Component composition over route complexity
 * - Business logic isolated in ProjectDetailPage component
 * 
 * üìù MODULE CONTEXT:
 * - Part of ProZen project management module
 * - Connects to ProjectDetailPage for individual project interface
 * - Supports project-specific functionality (tasks, team, reports)
 * 
 * üè∑Ô∏è RECOMMENDATION: KEEP - Clean implementation, minor param extraction improvement possible
 *
 * TODO: Consider extracting projectId param for better prop passing
