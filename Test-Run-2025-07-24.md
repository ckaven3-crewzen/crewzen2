# Test Run 2025-07-24

## Purpose
This document tracks all manual page-by-page and function tests, including any errors, issues, or changes needed. The goal is to identify error patterns and systematically address them to restore full functionality and resume development efficiently.




## ProZen Module

- **Page/Function:** ProZen Projects Page
- **Tested by:** [Your name or initials]
- **Result:** Pass
- **Errors/Issues:**
  - None
- **Notes/Next Steps:**
  - Layout is good, card layout works well. Task reporter button is not needed on this page. Consider upgrading with more features in the future.

- **Page/Function:** ProZen Project Detail Page
- **Tested by:** [Your name or initials]
- **Result:** Fail (Urgent)
- **Errors/Issues:**
  - Task tab, Reports tab, Team tab, Crew tab, and Access tab are all not working
- **Notes/Next Steps:**
  - Layout is good, but all major tabs are broken. This is a critical issueâ€”likely caused by the recent file reorganization. Investigate where these tabs are pulling their data/components from and resolve before any further ProZen testing. This is an urgent failure as it impacts the entire module.

## CrewZen Module Summary

All major CrewZen module pages and functions were tested:

- CrewZen Dashboard Page: 100% functional, all UI and data features work as expected.
- Employee Page: Fully functional, correct display, avatars, edit and add actions all work.
- Edit Employee Dialog: Layout is good, but needs fixes for role dropdown (not showing roles) and missing photo/documents section. Save works.
- Add Employee: Layout and fields are correct, but save/new employee creation failed. Needs investigation and fix for onboarding step 2 and save logic.
- Reports Page: Layout, dropdowns, preview, and CSV export work. PDF export fails due to missing or misconfigured jsPDF autoTable plugin.
- Settings Page: No errors, but appears redundant with ConnectZen company page. Consider refactor or removal after checking usages.

**Key Issues/Next Steps:**
- Add Employee save logic and onboarding step 2: **Fixed** (2025-07-24)
  - Onboarding now accepts either a new file or an already uploaded photo/ID copy URL. No more false errors if a photo was already uploaded.
- Update Edit Employee Dialog to show role dropdown and add photo/documents section.
- Fix PDF export on Reports Page (jsPDF autoTable plugin).
- Review Settings Page for redundancy and usages.

Overall, CrewZen core functionality is stable, with onboarding/save logic now fixed. Ready to proceed to ProZen module testing.
